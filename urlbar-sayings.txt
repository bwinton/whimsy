a lot of professionals are crackpots
a single event can have infinitely many interpretations
a strong sense of duty imprisons you
abstraction is a type of decadence
action causes more trouble than thought
alienation produces eccentrics or revolutionaries
ambition is just as dangerous as complacency
ambivalence can ruin your life
at times inactivity is preferable to mindless functioning
at times your unconsciousness is truer than your conscious mind
believing in rebirth is the same as admitting defeat
chasing the new is dangerous to society
confusing yourself is a way to stay honest
disorganization is a kind of anesthesia
dreaming while awake is a frightening contradiction
expiring for love is beautiful but stupid
fake or real indifference is a powerful personal weapon
ignoring enemies is the best way to fight
it's crucial to have an active fantasy life
lack of charisma can be fatal
people are nuts if they think they are important
planning for the future is escapism
self-awareness can be crippling
slipping into madness is good for the sake of comparison
sloppy thinking gets worse over time
the idea of revolution is an adolescent fantasy
the idea of transcendence is used to obscure oppression
when something terrible happens people wake up
words tend to be inadequate
your oldest fears are the worst ones
I wonder if anyone caught my clever reference to `navigator`.
